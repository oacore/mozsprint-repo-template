# Contributing to CORE @ Mozilla Global Sprint 2017

Thank you for your interest! 

CORE is aggregating 70 million research outputs and 7 million full text, we need your help to unleash the power of Open Access :)

We are looking for developer, data scientists, text miners, designers and testers to exploit as much as you want our dataset and APIs to increase the use and the visibility of Open Access in the world.
We have a list of ideas in the [issues](../../issues) section to get you started. Feel free to add more and more ideas to the issue tracker if you want.
In the following weeks we will continue making the issues growing with content and ideas.

>This documents is a set of guidelines for contributing to CORE @ Mozilla Global Sprint 2017 on GitHub. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.

If your guide is long, consider adding a table of contents.

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [EMAIL].

## How can you contribute?
We have plenty of ideas to work on, some of them are just a sentence or two and some of them are more detailed. If you head to [issues](../../issues) you will see some of them. 
There are many ways to contribute:

- if you are a developer in any language please help us build clients for our APIs. 

- if you are a machine learning specialist please use our dataset to create your models about any aspect of research.
- if you are data scientist you can get helpful insights on how the research world works. [This](https://blog.core.ac.uk/2016/10/21/analysing-orcid-coverage-across-repositories-through-core/) is for example our analysis of the uptake of ORCID identifiers in the world.
- if you find any bug, please help us collect them and improve our data and the access to it.

We are always welcome new ideas, feel free to add your own ideas directly in the issues.
If the APIs and the dataset are not enough please contact us we will try our best to offer you all the data we have available.

## How to submit changes

## How to report bugs
We are well aware that aggregating 70 million research papers raise a lot of inconsistencies and possible conflict. If you spot any of this, please report it to our issue tracker here [issue tracker](../../issues), We will try to address the issue as soon as possible.
